Just like a fancy code snippet, this is a terminal snippet for your blog!

## Usage
1. Include `TerminalSnippet.min.css` and `TerminalSnippet.min.js` into your html file.
2. Use the `<terminal-snippet></terminal-snippet>` html tag to insert your terminal block.
3. For extra formatting, you can apply `id="command"` to get the teal color and `id="folder"` to get the blue color

Check out the example.html file for clarification.

## Notes
1. Modifying the titlebar requires modifying the css and javascript files
2. This has been tested and works in IE, Edge, Chrome, and Firefox
